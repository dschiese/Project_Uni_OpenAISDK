<START PROBLEM STATEMENT>
Add check to ensure max_length fits longest choice.
Description
	
There is currently no check to ensure that Field.max_length is large enough to fit the longest value in Field.choices.
This would be very helpful as often this mistake is not noticed until an attempt is made to save a record with those values that are too long.

Step 2 output: The bug in the `Field` class related to the `max_length` check and `choices` has been addressed. The modification ensures that the maximum length of the choices is properly validated against the `max_length` property when checking for errors. The complete and updated file has been successfully written. If you need further assistance, just let me know!
