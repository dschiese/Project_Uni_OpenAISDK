<START PROBLEM STATEMENT>
Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings
Description
	
Consider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:
from django import forms
class ColorPicker(forms.Widget):
	class Media:
		js = ['color-picker.js']
class SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):
	class Media:
		js = ['text-editor.js']
class FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):
	class Media:
		js = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']
class MyForm(forms.Form):
	background_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())
	intro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())
	body = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())
Django should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:
/projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:
text-editor-extras.js
text-editor.js
 MediaOrderConflictWarning,
Media(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])
The MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.
The final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the "naïve" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)

------------------------------
Step 2 output: It seems that I'm unable to access the file you specified due to an issue. However, I can provide you with a general approach to fix the `MediaOrderConflictWarning`.

Here's how you could generally resolve the warning:

1. **Identify the Merge Function**: Locate the function responsible for merging media files — it might be named `merge_media` or something similar.

2. **Adjust Order of JavaScript Files**: Ensure that within this function or wherever the media files are being added, `text-editor.js` is added after `text-editor-extras.js`.

3. **Update the Merge Logic**: If needed, modify the logic to check for dependencies and respect their order.

4. **Testing**: After making the changes, run the relevant tests to make sure the issue is resolved.

If you can provide me with the content of the file or more context regarding the implementation, I would be able to generate a specific corrected version for you. Alternatively, you can check the structure of the file to see how the media merging is being handled and make direct adjustments based on the above guidelines.
